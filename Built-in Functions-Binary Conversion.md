# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16 
print(bin(a)
```
## Output
![438594512-4eafa400-ea6d-4adf-94a9-35772e16f6cc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1af89a27-30cb-4a17-8d02-e70dde1cc839)


## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
